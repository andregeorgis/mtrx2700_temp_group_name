## Exercise 1 Memory and Pointers

#### Code Functionality


#### Code Modularity
The main code is broken up into four sections. Each of these sections would perform one task and the next task can't be performed until the current task is completed. The subroutines are also set into their blocks depending on how many tasks require it, similar roles they perform and their relative location. In our case, the subroutine to transform letters into uppercase or lowercase would be used by all tasks at some point, but the storing the previous character would only be used by tasks 3 and 4.
